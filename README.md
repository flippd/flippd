# Flippd

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sean-duffy/flippd.svg?branch=comments)](https://travis-ci.org/sean-duffy/flippd)

Flippd has been developed at the University of York to support modules with pre-recorded lecture content. It is currently a minimally viable product, and is being trialled as part of Designing and Maintaining Software, a new module in the Department of Computer Science. Flippd allows students to access lecture videos and supporting material, and allows lecturers to upload and organise lecture material via a separate Git repository (e.g., [https://github.com/york-cs-dams/flippd-dams](https://github.com/york-cs-dams/flippd-dams)).
