# This is a slightly odd feature right now, because we inspect the state of the
#Â database to check that results are correct. In a future version of Flippd,
# perhaps it would make sense to instead provide a view (only for module leaders)
# that lists all of the users for that VLE. These tests can then be rewritten to
# inspect the content of a web page rather than reaching into the database.
